The below command sets up company table based on the mock data.

You must then go to your webpage and execute "Batch Create" by clicking the button.

The web server is listening on port 80 on all ips by default.  If you've installed this on a vm - use the IP address for the vm or set up a custom hostname.

If you choose to delete the mock data and import linkedin data.  Here are the commands. (You should replace mock_contacts.csv with the CSV data from linkedin.)

CSV_FILE="/usr/share/jobassist/data/mock_contacts.csv"

sudo su - postgres -c "psql -d contact_db -c \"delete from contacts;\""

sudo su - postgres -c "psql -d contact_db -c \"\\copy contacts (first_name, last_name, url, email_address, company, position, connected_on) FROM '$CSV_FILE' WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER TRUE);\""
