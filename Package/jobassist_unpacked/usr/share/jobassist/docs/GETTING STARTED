Here are some commands needed to get started with the mock data.
The below command sets up company table based on the mock data.

sudo -u jobert /usr/share/jobassist/venv/bin/python /usr/share/jobassist/bin/regenerate_unmapped.py

You must then go to your webpage and execute "Batch Create" by clicking the button.
If you've added your host to /etc/hosts as testy you can access it at:

http://testy/cleanup.html

Alternatively you can use localhost or ip address if you have not set up a custom hostname.

If you choose to delete the mock data and import linkedin data.  Here are the commands. (You should replace mock_contacts.csv with the CSV data from linkedin.)

CSV_FILE="/usr/share/jobassist/data/mock_contacts.csv"

su - postgres -c "psql -d contact_db -c \"delete from contacts;\""

su - postgres -c "psql -d contact_db -c \"\\copy contacts (first_name, last_name, url, email_address, company, position, connected_on) FROM '$CSV_FILE' WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER TRUE);\""
